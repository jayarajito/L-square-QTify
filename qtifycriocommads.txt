Deploy your latest implementation
Donâ€™t forget to push your latest code to your QTify GitHub repository and make sure your deployed Vercel link has the latest implementation including the components you built in this module.


Test your implementation
It is mandatory to run the assessment script before you push your code for assessment.

Create a new file called as submit.txt. This file must be in your project folder, do not create any separate folder for it.

Paste your deployed link in the submit.txt. There should be nothing else in this file except your project link.

Run the runAssessment.sh script to run the integration tests present in the assessment folder.


cd ~/workspace/jayarajito-ME_QTIFY

chmod +x run_assessment.sh

./run_assessment.sh
